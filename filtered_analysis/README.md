# Filtered Analysis

### Filter icu dataset for hyponatremic patients by using command ```make build_hn_dataset ```
### Remove all files / conda environments with command ```make clean```


This directory contains tools for filtering the mimic iv icu dataset (specifically, this is built for the demo dataset, but the full dataset will work just as well.)
